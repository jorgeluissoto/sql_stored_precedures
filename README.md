Project Overview
Welcome to Your Guided Project!

Welcome to Working with SQL Stored Procedures using MySQL Workbench. This is an intermediate project-based course that should take approximately 2 hours to finish. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:

Guided Project Objectives

In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

Create stored procedures with and without input parameter(s)
Create stored procedures with output parameter(s)
By the end of this project-based course, you will be able to create and use stored procedures to produce more efficient queries to perform data aggregation, reporting, manipulation and querying for database insights using the projectdb database.

Guided Project Structure

This course is divided into six (6) parts:
